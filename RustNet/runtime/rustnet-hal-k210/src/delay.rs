//! Delay and monotonic clock, off the core's own cycle counter.
//!
//! `mcycle` is 64 bits wide on RV64 and reads in a single instruction, which
//! makes this markedly simpler than the Cortex-M port: no 32-bit wrap to track,
//! no peripheral to ungate, no trace unit to enable. At 400 MHz the counter
//! takes 1400 years to overflow, so `now_us` is monotonic for every practical
//! purpose.
//!
//! `mcycle` rather than the user-mode `cycle` alias: the firmware runs in
//! machine mode, where `mcycle` is unconditionally readable, whereas `cycle`
//! needs `mcounteren` to have been opened up first.
//!
//! The CLINT's `mtime` would also serve, but it ticks at a divided rate the
//! datasheet does not pin down as clearly as the core clock, and this counter
//! is both finer and cheaper to read.

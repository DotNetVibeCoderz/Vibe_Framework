//! I²C — the K210's three DesignWare masters.
//!
//! | HAL bus | Controller | What it reaches on a Maix Go |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | I2C0 | the header's `IIC_SCL`/`IIC_SDA` on IO30/IO31 |
//! | 1 | I2C1 | free |
//! | 2 | I2C2 | the camera's control lines on IO40/IO41 |
//!
//! **The camera is on bus 2**, at 100 kHz. Its control channel is SCCB, which
//! looks enough like I²C to be driven by an I²C master, and MaixPy drives it
//! with exactly this one — despite the chip also having a dedicated SCCB
//! master inside the DVP block, and despite the pads being labelled
//! `DVP_SDA`/`DVP_SCL`. [`crate::camera`] has the story.
//!
//! Two details of this controller are worth knowing before reading the code.
//!
//! **The target address is a register, not part of the transfer.** `tar` has to
//! be written before a transaction and the controller has to be *disabled* to
//! change it, so every call here re-arms the peripheral rather than streaming
//! into an already-running one.
//!
//! **The controller must not be disabled while the bus is still busy.** An
//! empty transmit FIFO means the last byte has been *popped*, not that it has
//! been clocked out, so disabling there cuts the transfer off mid-byte and can
//! leave a slave holding SDA low. A bus stuck that way answers *every* address
//! with an acknowledge, which reads as a board covered in devices rather than
//! as a driver bug — this port scanned one and got acks from 0x30 upwards.
//! `status.activity` going quiet is the real end of a transfer.
//!
//! **A NAK is not an error return, it is a status bit.** `tx_abrt_source` latches
//! why a transfer gave up, and reading it is the only way to tell "the device
//! is not there" from "the bus is idle because nothing was sent". Missing that
//! turns an absent device into a silent success.

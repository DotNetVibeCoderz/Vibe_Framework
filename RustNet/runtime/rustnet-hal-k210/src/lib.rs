//! Kendryte K210 (dual-core RV64GC) board implementation of the RustNet HAL.
//!
//! The K210 is an unusual target for this runtime, and in a helpful direction:
//! **6 MB of on-chip SRAM.** Where the STM32F401 port has to justify every
//! kilobyte of heap, here the IL interpreter, its heap, an inbound signed
//! container and a 320×240 framebuffer all fit at once with room to spare. What
//! it does *not* have is any internal flash — the mask ROM copies the firmware
//! out of an external SPI NOR part into SRAM and jumps there — so persistence
//! means driving that chip, which [`flash`] does.
//!
//! Bring-up status: FPIOA muxing, GPIOHS, UARTHS and UART1..3, an `mcycle`
//! clock, the three SPI masters and the boot flash as `extmem(0)` all run at
//! register level. Everything else returns `NotSupported` with its integration
//! point named in the source.
//!
//! Two things shape the whole crate:
//!
//! **There is no pinout.** Any of the 48 pads can carry any of 256 peripheral
//! functions, so `Board::gpio(pin)` takes an *FPIOA pad* number and has to
//! allocate one of GPIOHS's 32 channels and route it before there is anything to
//! drive. That allocation is the board's job and lives here. For the same
//! reason the UARTs and SPI buses have no default pins — see
//! [`uart::UartDef`].
//!
//! **The clock tree is read, not written.** The ROM has already brought PLL0 up
//! by the time this runs, and re-programming a PLL that feeds the executing core
//! is the kind of change that either works or hangs silently.
//! [`sysctl::Clocks::detect`] recovers what is in force and everything scales off
//! that, so the firmware's boot banner reports the real core frequency on the
//! first hardware run.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p rustnet-hal-k210 --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
//! ```

//! SPI — the K210's three DesignWare SSI masters.
//!
//! | HAL bus | Controller | What it is for on a Maix board |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | SPI0 | the LCD header |
//! | 1 | SPI1 | the microSD slot |
//! | — | SPI2 | slave-only silicon; not a master, so not exposed |
//! | — | SPI3 | the boot flash, owned by [`crate::flash`] and reached as `extmem(0)` |
//!
//! Two K210 quirks are worth knowing before reading the register writes.
//!
//! **The transfer-mode field moves.** `tmod` sits at bits 8..9 of `ctrlr0` on
//! SPI0/1/2 but at bits 10..11 on SPI3. Kendryte's own driver special-cases it,
//! and getting it wrong on SPI3 leaves the controller in receive mode while you
//! think you are transmitting — a bus that clocks and says nothing.
//!
//! **Chip select is a mask, and it gates the clock.** Writing `ser` is what
//! starts a transfer; clearing it ends one. So the sequence is always: disable,
//! configure, enable, preload the transmit FIFO, *then* assert `ser` — which
//! keeps the first bytes from trickling out with gaps between them.
//!
//! Every FIFO wait is bounded. The STM32 port learned this the expensive way:
//! an unbounded wait on a bus that never clocks hangs the firmware before its
//! service loop starts, and that reads as a board which will not enumerate.

//! ST7789V panel over SPI0 in octal mode — the LCD on a Sipeed Maix board.
//!
//! This panel is not wired the way an ST7789V usually is. There is no MOSI: the
//! controller talks to it over an 8-bit parallel bus, which the K210 drives by
//! putting SPI0 in **octal** frame format and routing its eight data lines to
//! the DVP (camera-interface) pins with [`sysctl::set_spi0_dvp_data`]. Only two
//! signals go through FPIOA pads — chip select and the clock — plus two ordinary
//! GPIOHS outputs for reset and the data/command line.
//!
//! Consequences worth knowing before reading the code:
//!
//! * **A byte costs one clock.** Eight lines, eight bits. So the pixel rate is
//!   the SPI clock, not an eighth of it, and a 320×240 frame at 15 MHz takes
//!   about 10 ms of wire time.
//! * **The camera shares those pins.** A DVP driver and this cannot stream at
//!   the same time.
//! * **`dcx` is not part of the bus.** It is sampled by the panel per transfer,
//!   so it must be settled before chip select falls and left alone until the
//!   transfer ends. Every command here is therefore its own SPI transaction.
//!
//! **The controller is reconfigured before every transfer, and that is the
//! whole trick.** A command is an 8-bit *instruction*, its parameters are 8-bit
//! *address* units, and pixels are 32-bit units — and `spi_ctrlr0` has to say
//! which, every time, alongside the frame width. This driver spent a long while
//! setting one value for everything and getting a panel that accepted `SLPOUT`
//! and `DISPON` and then showed a single flat colour forever. The sequence and
//! the encodings here are MaixPy's `st7789.c` and `lcd_mcu.c`, mirrored,
//! because those demonstrably drive this screen.

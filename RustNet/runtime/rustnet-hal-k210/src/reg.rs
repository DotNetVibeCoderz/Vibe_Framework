//! Raw register access.
//!
//! Every peripheral in this crate is driven by absolute address, with no PAC and
//! no ownership tokens — the same choice `rustnet-hal-stm32` makes, and for the
//! same reason: the firmware needs to poke a handful of these from a panic
//! handler, where no peripheral value is in scope.
//!
//! **Off-chip these are no-ops.** The crate compiles for the host so it can be
//! unit-tested alongside the rest of the workspace, and a test that exercises
//! pad allocation or a baud divisor would otherwise dereference a K210
//! peripheral address on x86 and take the test runner down with it. Writes are
//! dropped and reads answer zero, which leaves every pure calculation testable
//! and makes anything that genuinely depends on a device's reply — a flash
//! status poll, a FIFO level — report a timeout instead of lying.

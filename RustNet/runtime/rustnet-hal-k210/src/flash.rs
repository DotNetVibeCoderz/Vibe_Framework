//! The board's SPI NOR flash, as an [`ExtMemory`] region.
//!
//! The K210 has **no internal flash at all**. The mask ROM reads the firmware
//! out of an external SPI NOR part on SPI3 and copies it into SRAM, then jumps
//! there — so unlike the STM32 port, writing to this flash cannot possibly be
//! the firmware erasing itself, and an erase does not stall the core. What it
//! does mean is that persistence is only available at all once someone drives
//! that chip, which is what this module is.
//!
//! Only a reserved window is exposed, and addresses passed in are relative to
//! it. That is the guard: the firmware image lives at offset 0 of the flash, so
//! a region that starts megabytes above it cannot reach the code that is
//! running, whatever the caller asks for.
//!
//! The command set is the universal W25Q/GD25Q subset — JEDEC ID, read status,
//! write enable, 4 KB sector erase, 256-byte page program, and a plain 3-byte
//! read. Every 16 Mbit-and-up part in a Maix board's footprint speaks it, so
//! this does not need to identify the die to work; it reads the ID only to
//! report it.
//!
//! **Unproven.** This is written against the datasheets and Kendryte's own
//! driver, and has never run. See the "what to check first" list in
//! `runtime/firmware-k210/README.md`.

//! RP2040 — a register-level HAL for RustNet, no PAC and no vendor SDK.
//!
//! Same shape as [`rustnet_hal_k210`] and `rustnet-hal-stm32`: a small crate
//! that talks to the chip through its memory map and implements the
//! [`rustnet_hal`] traits, so the interpreter and the firmware above it do not
//! know which silicon they are on.
//!
//! Three things about this part decide most of what follows.
//!
//! **Every peripheral comes out of reset held.** The `RESETS` block gates all
//! of them at power-up and a register write to a held peripheral is simply
//! lost — no fault, no hint. So [`resets::unreset`] comes before every driver
//! here, and it waits for the acknowledge rather than assuming it.
//!
//! **The chip boots at about 6 MHz on a ring oscillator**, not on its crystal.
//! Nothing in the datasheet's timing tables is true until the crystal and the
//! PLLs are running, so a UART configured before [`clocks::init`] is a UART at
//! whatever rate the ring oscillator drifted to that day.
//!
//! **Atomic register aliases replace read-modify-write.** Every peripheral
//! register is mirrored at `+0x1000` (XOR), `+0x2000` (set) and `+0x3000`
//! (clear). Using them is not an optimisation: a read-modify-write on a
//! register another core or an interrupt also touches loses whichever update
//! landed in between, and the RP2040 has two cores.
//!
//! Nothing here has run on hardware yet — see the port's README.
